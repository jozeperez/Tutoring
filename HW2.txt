Hey guys,

For homework #2 I want you guys to watch this tutorial video on HTML + CSS.
It is an hour long but it includes a great assignment that you guys will enjoy and learn a lot from.

Link to video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz0aGYrrlhU

You can also search YouTube for "HTML Tutorial for Beginners: HTML Crash Course" and make sure the author of the video is "Coding with Mosh".

Next week I want to see the website you guys created as part of the course. Be prepared to share your work with us during the class.
